Think you may have found a bug? This is the place.,"why can’t i post a question? | I want to post a question; how do i do that? | Hello ANBR,
I’ve  noticed wrist3 deviation (cyclical wobble-precession) through a 360 degree rotation, which really affects our center probe accuracy setup.
What is the maximum wrist 3 deviation of an UR3.
Am I missing something? New to UR robotics…
Please advise
Thanks | Hi i am having a problem with my ur10 cb3,when im trying to start it,a fault appears
SafetyA:C192A20:Safety system fault:SPI output error detected
Explanation;
Powersupply for the I/O is not detected
how do I fix it?
Thank you | Hello everyone, I need your help
I am working on human-robot interaction control with compliance. I successfully designed and implemented admittance control on the UR robot however, to test the performance of the controller during the robot  interaction with human I need to free-drive the robot joints while in remote control mode to show the compliance.
my challenge is that I cant move the robot freely which is difficult to show that the control is working.
please what should I do? | UR10 wrist2 will shake randomly, | I would like to know if for a UR10e robot, the encoder signal decoding frequency marked in the documentation is a maximum value or a minimum value.
i would like to use the conveyor tracking function in my project
Indeed in the doc as you can see it’s marked 40Khz but it’s not very clear to me.
please help

Remote TCP & Toolpath fails to start in UR simulator,https://forum.universal-robots.com/t/remote-tcp-toolpath-fails-to-start-in-ur-simulator/37757,"Hi everyone,
I am trying to get the Remote TCP & Toolpath URCap working in my UR simulator. However, whenever I try to start the controller in the installation tab of the URCap, I get the status: “Failed”.
Details:

Polyscope version: 5.19
URCap version: 1.4.2
VM software: VirtualBox

Has anyone experienced this issue or have any insights into what might be causing it? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks in advance!","I have the same problem, same Version 5.19 and URCap 1.4.2 and VirtualBOX
I tried this from 2020
Remote TCP & Toolpath URCap Controller Start Failed - URCap Development / URCaps SDK - Universal Robots Forum
but it didn’t work.
Has anybody a solution?"
